# 3. Conclusion

Congrats! You've learned how to use /z for club meetings, workshops, and other Hack Club events.

We think /z is at feature parity with having your own paid Zoom Pro account. We even cancelled our own HQ Zoom Pro accounts and have been entirely using /z since February of 2021. That said, if you find something you need that isn't in /z, or you discover any bugs, please let us know in the `#development-of-slash-z` channel on Slack, or DM `@msw`.

> <icon:bug size="26" color="#ec3750" /> **Note:** Hack Club HQ keeps some logs from /z in order to squash bugs and restrict it to just Hack Clubbers. If you're not a Hack Clubber or running a meeting for Hack Club, you're not allowed to use /z.
