# 1.1. Claiming Host

## Host Keys
When you start a metting with Slash-Z, you're given a host key. This is a 6-digit number that you can enter in Zoom to take host controls of a room, which is important for running a meeting.

At the end of the message you can see the host key, which is `977996` in this picture.
To claim host permissions in Zoom, open the participants menu and click on Claim Host.
